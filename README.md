IP Multiviewer

This project is going to be a combination of AI generated code and code produced by a human. The idea for this project is to create a multiviewer capable of being used to monitor broadcast IP video streams on an internal network. 

My goal is to make this as scalable as possible and make it compatible with as many formats as I can. This is including but not limited to NDI, UDP, and RTP video streams. 

This is a learning project and a work in progress not meant to be used in any kind of production environment.
